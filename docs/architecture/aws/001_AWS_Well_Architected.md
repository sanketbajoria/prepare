The [AWS Well-Architected Framework ](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected/)is used by AWS to help workloads adhere to best practices. AWS partners provide Well-Architected reviews to ensure that customer workloads are configured optimally.

## The AWS Well-Architected Pillars

There are 5 pillars which cover:

- **C**ost Optimization — how to keep workload costs to a minimum
- **O**perational Excellence — focusing on how systems that are in play can be maintained on a day-to-day basis
- **R**eliability — ensuring that a workload can recover from outages with minimal disruption
- **P**erformance Efficiency — checking that the workload is using the correct compute resources for their workloads by implementing monitoring
- **S**ecurity — confirming that workloads are running in a secure environment

All AWS professionals should know these pillars like the back of their hand. A good way to remember them is by using the acronym **CORPS**.

## AWS Well-Architected Lens

AWS also has the concept of the Well-Architected “Lens”. These focus on best practices revolving around specific technologies:

- **H**igh Performance Computing (HPC) — architecting workloads where there are intensive compute requirements
- **I**nternet of **T**hings (IoT) — focusing on systems that include IoT device commands, updates and telemetry
- **S**erverless Application — designing and implementing serverless solutions

A way to remember the Well-Architected Lenses is by using the acronym **HITS.**
