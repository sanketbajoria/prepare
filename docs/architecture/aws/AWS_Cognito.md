# AWS Cognito

It is an Identity Provider and User's Directory. It provide basic functionality such as Sign In, Sign Out, Registration etc.. 

User Pool is a database of Users for a particular app.

It uses JWT to maintain session, and localstorage on client side to store and maintain it.



AWS amplify by default, manages the access token and refresh token on client automatically, so we don't have to handle it out.
