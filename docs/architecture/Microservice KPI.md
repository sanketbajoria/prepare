Key performance indicators (KPIs) for microservices are metrics that provide insights into the health and efficiency of microservices-based applications. Some common KPIs include: 

| KPI | What it measures |
| -------- | ------- |
| Response time | How long it takes for a microservice to respond to a request |
| Throughput | How many requests or transactions a microservice processes per unit of time |
| Error rate | The percentage of requests or transactions that fail |
| Resource utilization | How much CPU and memory a microservice uses |
| Availability | How often a microservice is accessible and operational |
| Health | Continuously checks for unhealthy services and stops routing traffic to them. Checks the health of microservice dependencies to prevent cascading failures |


Other practices for monitoring microservices include: 

-   Distributed tracing

    Tracks the flow of requests across services to understand how they are processed 

-   Logging

    Records events that occur while microservices are running 

-   Exception tracking

    Catches errors, code messages, and stack traces that occur when a microservice processes a request
    
-   Saturation
  
    Assess the capacity of your microservices. Saturation metrics help you determine if a microservice is reaching its resource limits.

-   Traffic Patterns
  
    Understand the incoming and outgoing traffic patterns to identify irregularities or unexpected behavior.
