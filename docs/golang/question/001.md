## Questions on Golang Basics



### 1. What are the benefits of using Go compared to other languages?

- Unlike other languages which started as academic experiments, Go code is pragmatically designed. Every feature and syntax decision is engineered to make life easier for the programmer.
- Golang is optimized for concurrency and works well at scale.
- Golang is often considered more readable than other languages due to a single standard code format.
- Automatic garbage collection is notably more efficient than Java or Python because it executes concurrently alongside the program.



### 2. What are string literals?

A string literal is a string constant formed by concatenating characters. The two forms of string literal are raw and interpreted string literals.

Raw string literals are written within backticks (`foo`) and are filled with uninterpreted UTF-8 characters. Interpreted string literals are what we commonly think of as strings, written within double quotes and containing any character except newline and unfinished double quotes.



### 3. What data types does Golang use?

Golang uses the following types:

- Method
- Boolean
- Numeric
- String
- Array
- Slice
- Struct
- Pointer
- Function
- Interface
- Map
- Channel



### 4. What are packages in a Go program?

Packages (`pkg`) are directories within your Go workspace that contain Go source files or other packages. Every function, variable, and type from your source files are stored in the linked package. Every Go source file belongs to a package, which is declared at the top of the file using:

```go
package <packagename>
```

You can import and export packages to reuse exported functions or types using:

```go
import <packagename>
```

Golang’s standard package is `fmt`, which contains formatting and printing functionalities like `Println()`.



### 5. What form of type conversion does Go support? Convert an integer to a float.

Go supports explicit type conversion to satisfy its strict typing requirements.

```go
i := 55      //int

j := 67.8    //float64

sum := i + int(j) //j is converted to int
```



### 6. What is a goroutine? How do you stop it?

A [goroutine](https://www.educative.io/blog/golang-tutorial#goroutine) is a function or method that executes concurrently alongside any other goroutines using a special goroutine thread. Goroutine threads are more lightweight than standard threads, with most Golang programs using thousands of goroutines at once.

To create a goroutine, add the `go` keyword before the function declaration.

```go
go f(x, y, z)
```

You can stop a goroutine by sending it a signal channel. Goroutines can only respond to signals if told to check, so you’ll need to include checks in logical places such as at the top of your `for` loop.

```go
package main
func main() {
  quit := make(chan bool)
  go func() {
    for {
        select {
        case <-quit:
            return
        default:
            // …
        }
  }
}()
// …
quit <- true
}
```

### 7. How do you check a variable type at runtime?

The Type Switch is the best way to check a variable’s type at runtime. The Type Switch evaluates variables by type rather than value. Each Switch contains at least one `case`, which acts as a conditional statement, and a `default` case, which executes if none of the cases are true.

For example, you could create a Type Switch that checks if interface value `i` contains the type `int` or `string`:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func do(i interface{}) {
	switch v := i.(type) {
	case int:
		fmt.Printf("Double %v is %v\n", v, v*2)
	case string:
		fmt.Printf("%q is %v bytes long\n", v, len(v))
	default:
		fmt.Printf("I don't know  type %T!\n", v)
	}
}

func main() {
	do(21)
	do("hello")
	do(true)
}
```



### 8. How do you concatenate strings?

The easiest way to [concatenate strings](https://www.educative.io/blog/concatenate-string-c) is to use the concatenation operator (`+`), which allows you to add strings as you would numerical values.



## Intermediate Golang Questions



### 9. Explain the steps of testing with Golang.

Golang supports automated testing of packages with custom testing suites.

To create a new suite, create a file that ends with `_test.go` and includes a `TestXxx` function, where `Xxx` is replaced with the name of the feature you’re testing. For example, a function that tests login capabilities would be called `TestLogin`.

You then place the testing suite file in the same package as the file you wish to test. The test file will be skipped on regular execution but will run when you enter the `go test` command.



### 10. What are function closures?

Function closures is a function value that references variables from outside its body. The function may access and assign values to the referenced variables.

For example: `adder()` returns a closure, which is each bound to its own referenced `sum` variable.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func adder() func(int) int {
	sum := 0
	return func(x int) int {
		sum += x
		return sum
	}
}

func main() {
	pos, neg := adder(), adder()
	for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
		fmt.Println(
			pos(i),
			neg(-2*i),
		)
	}
}
```



### 11. How do we perform inheritance with Golang?

This is a bit of a trick question: there is no [inheritance](https://www.educative.io/blog/java-inheritance-tutorial) in Golang because it does not support classes.

However, you can mimic inheritance behavior using composition to use an existing struct object to define a starting behavior of a new object. Once the new object is created, functionality can be extended beyond the original struct.

```go
type Animal struct {
    // …
}

func (a *Animal) Eat()   { … }
func (a *Animal) Sleep() { … }
func (a *Animal) Run() { … }

type Dog struct {
    Animal
    // …
}
```

The `Animal` struct contains `Eat()`, `Sleep()`, and `Run()` functions. These functions are embedded into the child struct `Dog` by simply listing the struct at the top of the implementation of `Dog`.



### 12. Explain Go interfaces. What are they and how do they work?

Interfaces are a special type in Go that define a set of method signatures but do not provide implementations. Values of interface type can hold any value that implements those methods.

Interfaces essentially act as placeholders for methods that will have multiple implementations based on what object is using it.

For example, you could implement a `geometry` interface that defines that all shapes that use this interface must have an implementation of `area()` and `perim()`.

```go
type geometry interface {
    area() float64
    perim() float64
}
```



### 13. What are Lvalue and Rvalue in Golang?

**Lvalue**

- Refers to a memory location
- Represents a variable identifier
- Mutable
- May appear on the left or right side of the `=` operator

> For example: In the statement `x =20`, `x` is an lvalue and `20` is an rvalue.

**Rvalue**

- Represents a data value stored in memory
- Represents a constant value
- Always appears on the `=` operator’s right side.

> For example, The statement `10 = 20` is invalid because there is an rvalue (`10`) left of the `=` operator.



### 14. What are the looping constructs in Go?

Go has only one looping construct: the `for` loop. The `for` loop has 3 components separated by semicolons:

- The `Init` statement, which is executed before the loop begins. It’s often a variable declaration only visible within the scope of the `for` loop.
- The condition expression, which is evaluated as a Boolean before each iteration to determine if the loop should continue.
- The post statement, which is executed at the end of each iteration.


```go
package main
import "fmt"

func main() {
  sum := 0
  for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
​    sum += i
  }
  fmt.Println(sum)
}
```


### 15. Can you return multiple values from a function?

Yes. A Go function can return multiple values, each separated by commas in the `return` statement.
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func foo() (string, string) {
  return "two", "values"
}
func main() {
  fmt.Println(foo())
}
```

## Coding challenges with Golang



### 16. Implement a Stack (LIFO)

Implement a stack structure with pop, append, and print top functionalities.

**Solution**

You can implement a stack using a slice object.
```go

import "fmt"

func main() {

// Create

var stack []string

// Push

stack = append(stack, "world!")

stack = append(stack, "Hello ")

for len(stack) > 0 {

​    // Print top

​    n := len(stack) - 1

​    fmt.Print(stack[n])

​    // Pop

​    stack = stack[:n]

}

// Output: Hello world!

}
```


First, we use the built-in `append()` function to implement the append behavior. Then we use `len(stack)-1` to select the top of the stack and print.

For pop, we set the new length of the stack to the position of the printed top value, `len(stack)-1`.



### 17. Print all permutations of a slice characters or string

Implement the `perm()` function that accepts a slice or string and prints all possible combinations of characters.

**Solution**
```go
package main

import "fmt"

// Perm calls f with each permutation of a.

func Perm(a []rune, f func([]rune)) {

​    perm(a, f, 0)

}

// Permute the values at index i to len(a)-1.

func perm(a []rune, f func([]rune), i int) {

​    if i > len(a) {

​        f(a)

​        return

​    }

​    perm(a, f, i+1)

​    for j := i + 1; j < len(a); j++ {

​        a[i], a[j] = a[j], a[i]

​        perm(a, f, i+1)

​        a[i], a[j] = a[j], a[i]

​    }

}

func main() {

Perm([]rune("abc"), func(a []rune) {

​    fmt.Println(string(a))

})

}
```

We use rune types to handle both slices and strings. Runes are Unicode code points and can therefore parse strings and slices equally.

### 18. Swap the values of two variables without a temporary variable

Implement `swap()` which swaps the value of two variables without using a third variable.

**Solution**

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {

  fmt.Println(swap())

}

func swap() []int {
  a, b := 15, 10
  b, a = a, b
  return []int{a, b}
}
```

While this may be tricky in other languages, Go makes it easy.

We can simply include the statement `b, a = a, b`, what data the variable references without engaging with either value.


### 19. Implement min and max behavior

Implement `Min(x, y int)` and `Max(x, y int)` functions that take two integers and return the lesser or greater value, respectively.

**Solution**

By default, Go only supports min and max for floats using `math.min` and `math.max`. You’ll have to create your own implementations to make it work for integers.

​    if x > y {

​        return y

​    }

​    return x

}

// Max returns the larger of x or y.

func Max(x, y int) int {

​    if x < y {

​        return y

​    }

​    return x

}

func main() { 

  fmt.Println(Min(5,10))

  fmt.Println(Max(5,10))

}



Run





### 20. Reverse the order of a slice

Implement function `reverse` that takes a slice of integers and reverses the slice in place without using a temporary slice.

​    for a, b := 0, len(sw)-1; a < b; a, b = a+1, b-1 {

​        sw[a], sw[b] = sw[b], sw[a]

​    } 

}

func main() { 

  x := []int{3, 2, 1} 

  reverse(x)

  fmt.Println(x)

}



Run



Our for loop swaps the values of each element in the slice will slide from left to right. Eventually, all elements will be reversed.



### 21. What is the easiest way to check if a slice is empty?

Create a program that checks if a slice is empty. Find the simplest solution.

**Solution**

The easiest way to check if a slice is empty is to use the built-in `len()` function, which returns the length of a slice. If `len(slice) == 0`, then you know the slice is empty.

For example:

1

2

3

4

5

6

7

8

9

10

11

12

13

14

package main

import "fmt"

func main() {

 r := [3]int{1, 2, 3}

 if len(r) == 0 {

  fmt.Println("Empty!")

  

 } else {

  fmt.Println("Not Empty!")

 }

}



Run





### 22. Format a string without printing it

Find the easiest way to format a string with variables without printing the value.

**Solution**

The easiest way to format without printing is to use the `fmt.Sprintf()`, which returns a string without printing it.

For example:

1

2

3

4

5

6

7

8

package main

import "fmt"

func main() {

 s := fmt.Sprintf("Size: %d MB.", 85)

 fmt.Println(s)

}



Run







## Golang Concurrency Questions



### 23. Explain the difference between concurrent and parallelism in Golang

[Concurrency](https://www.educative.io/blog/multithreading-and-concurrency-fundamentals) is when your program can *handle* multiple tasks at once while parallelism is when your program can *execute* multiple tasks at once using multiple processors.

In other words, concurrency is a property of a program that allows you to have multiple tasks in progress at the same time, but not necessarily executing at the same time. Parallelism is a runtime property where two or more tasks are executed at the same time.

Parallelism can therefore be a means to achieve the property of concurrency, but it is just one of many means available to you.

The key tools for concurrency in Golang are goroutines and channels. Goroutines are concurrent lightweight threads while channels allow goroutines to communicate with each other during execution.



### 24. Merge Sort

Implement a concurrent [Merge Sort](https://www.educative.io/blog/algorithms-101-merge-sort-quicksort) solution using goroutines and channels.

You can use this sequential Merge Sort implementation as a starting point:

   return append(merged,right...)

  }else if len(right) == 0 {

   return append(merged,left...)

  }else if left[0] < right[0] {

   merged = append(merged, left[0])

   left = left[1:]

  }else{

   merged = append(merged, right [0])

   right = right[1:]

  }

 }

 return merged

}

func MergeSort(data [] int) [] int {

 if len(data) <= 1 {

  return data

 }

 mid := len(data)/2

 left := MergeSort(data[:mid])

 right := MergeSort(data[mid:])

 return Merge(left,right)

}

func main(){

 data := [] int{9,4,3,6,1,2,10,5,7,8}

 fmt.Printf("%v\n%v\n", data, MergeSort(data))

}



Run



**Solution**


```go
package main

import "fmt"

func Merge(left, right [] int) [] int{

 merged := make([] int, 0, len(left) + len(right))

 for len(left) > 0 || len(right) > 0{

  if len(left) == 0 {

   return append(merged,right...)

  }else if len(right) == 0 {

   return append(merged,left...)

  }else if left[0] < right[0] {

   merged = append(merged, left[0])

   left = left[1:]

  }else{

   merged = append(merged, right [0])

   right = right[1:]

  }

 }

 return merged

}

func MergeSort(data [] int) [] int {

 if len(data) <= 1 {

  return data

 }

 done := make(chan bool)

 mid := len(data)/2

 var left [] int

 go func(){

  left = MergeSort(data[:mid])

  done <- true

 }
}
```

Firstly, in merge sort, we keep dividing our array recursively into the `right` side and the `left` side and call the `MergeSort` function on both sides from **line 30** to **line 34**.

Now we have to make sure that `Merge(left,right)` is executed after we get return values from both the recursive calls, i.e. both the `left` and `right` must be updated before `Merge(left,right)` can be executable. Hence, we introduce a channel of type `bool` on **line 26** and send `true` on it as soon as `left = MergeSort(data[:mid])` is executed (**line 32**).

The `<-done` operation blocks the code on **line 35** before the statement `Merge(left,right)` so that it does not proceed until our goroutine has finished. After the goroutine has finished and we receive `true` on the `done` channel, the code proceeds forward to `Merge(left,right)` statement on **line 36**.



### 25. Sum of Squares

Implement the `SumOfSquares` function which takes an integer, `c` and returns the sum of all squares between 1 and `c`. You’ll need to use `select` statements, goroutines, and channels.

For example, entering `5` would return `55` because 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2 = 5512+22+32+42+52=55

You can use the following code as a starting point:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func SumOfSquares(c, quit chan int) {

// your code here

}

func main() {

 mychannel := make(chan int)

 quitchannel:= make(chan int)

 sum:= 0

 go func() {

  for i := 0; i < 6; i++ {

   sum += <-mychannel

  }

  fmt.Println(sum)

 }()

 SumOfSquares(mychannel, quitchannel)

}
```


**Solution**

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func SumOfSquares(c, quit chan int) {

 y := 1

 for {

  select {

  case c <- (y*y):

   y++

  case <-quit:

   return

  }

 }

}

func main() {

 mychannel := make(chan int)

 quitchannel:= make(chan int)

 sum:= 0

 go func() {

  for i := 1; i <= 5; i++ {

   sum += <-mychannel

  }

  fmt.Println(sum)

  quitchannel <- 0

 }()

 SumOfSquares(mychannel, quitchannel)

}
```


Take a look at our `SumOfSquares` function. First, on **line 4**, we declare a variable `y` and then jump to the `For-Select` loop. We have two cases in our select statements:

- `case c <- (y*y)`: This is to send the square of `y` through the channel `c`, which is received in the goroutine created in the main routine.
- `case <-quit`: This is to receive a message from the main routine that will return from the function.

## 1. What’s the difference between a goroutine and an operating system thread?

- Go provides built-in channels for goroutines to communicate safely between themselves.
- More goroutines can run on a typical system than system threads. For example, with Java, you can run many *thousands* of threads. With Go, you can run many *millions* of goroutines.
- Goroutines startup more quickly than operating system threads.
- Multiple Goroutines are multiplexed onto OS threads, rather than a 1:1 mapping.
- You can write massively concurrent servers without having to resort to event programming.
- Goroutines are not hardware-dependent like threads.
- Goroutines are more lightweight, largely due to [segmented stacks](https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-stacks-are-handled-in-go/#segmentedstacks) in memory

## 2. Can constants be computed in Go?

Constants can **not** be computed at runtime, their value must be known at compile time. That said, constants can be computed at compile-time, typically as a derivative of other constants. For example:

```
const hours = 7643

const minutes = hours * 60
Code language: Go (go)
```

## 3. What does the Go ecosystem use for package and dependency management?

Until recently the GOPATH setup allowed developers to import packages as long as they were in the local Go workspace. As of Go ~1.13 it’s recommended to use `go mod`. With `go mod`, source code isn’t required to be a part of the `GOPATH` environment variable.

Go doesn’t use a package manager like NPM or Cargo. The Go toolchain provides commands like `go get` for fetching external dependencies straight from their remote source control repositories, and `go mod` for managing the dependencies of a specific project.

## 4. How would you succinctly swap the values of two variables in Go?

```
var1, var2 = var2, var1Code language: Go (go)
```

## 5. Do you have any preferences for error handling methodologies in Go?

Errors in Go are an interface type, where any type that implements the single `Error()` method can be considered an error:

```
type error interface {
    Error() string
}Code language: Go (go)
```

Whenever a function has a possibility to go wrong, like a network call or a type conversion, the function should return an error as its last return variable. The caller should check the error value, and any value other than `nil` is considered an error.

Idiomatic Go developers should prefer [guard clauses](https://qvault.io/2019/08/16/guard-clauses-how-to-clean-up-conditionals/) over if-else chains, especially when handling errors. Errors should also be [wrapped in a meaningful way](https://qvault.io/2020/03/09/wrapping-errors-in-go-how-to-handle-nested-errors/) as they are passed up the call stack if appropriate.

## 6. What is a pointer and when would you use it?

A [pointer](https://qvault.io/2019/09/25/the-proper-use-of-pointers-in-go-golang/) holds the memory address of a value.

- `&` generates a pointer to its operand.
- `*` dereferences a pointer (exposes the underlying value).

Pointers can be used to:

- Allow a function to directly mutate a value that is passed to it
- To increase performance in edge cases. Sometimes passing a large struct of data results in inefficient copying of data
- To signify the lack of a value. For example, when [unmarshalling JSON data](https://qvault.io/golang/json-golang/) into a struct it can be useful to know if a key was absent rather than it being present with the zero value.

## 7. Describe the difference between [sync.Mutex](https://golang.org/pkg/sync/#Mutex) and [sync.RWMutex](https://golang.org/pkg/sync/#RWMutex)

The normal mutex locks data so that only one goroutine can access it at a time.

A [RWMutex (read/write)](https://qvault.io/2020/03/19/golang-mutexes-what-is-rwmutex-for/) can lock data for “reading” and for “writing”. When locked for reading, other readers can also lock and access data. When locked for writing no other goroutines, including other readers can access the data.

## 8. Consider the following code. What will be the value of s1?

```
primes := [6]int{2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13}
s1 := primes[1:4]Code language: Go (go)
s1` will be: `[3 5 7]
```

When slicing an existing array or slice the first index is inclusive while the last index is exclusive. If an index is omitted on one side of the colon, then all values until the edge of the original slice are included in the result.

## 9. Are channels and maps safe for concurrent access?

Channels are safe for concurrent access, for this reason they have blocking operations. Maps are unsafe for concurrent access and require a locking mechanism like a mutex to be safely used across goroutines.

## 10. How would you [sort](https://qvault.io/2020/05/27/sorting-in-go-dont-reinvent-this-wheel/) a slice of custom structs?

I would build a new type that represents a slice of that struct type. For example:

```
type fruitSlice[]fruit

type car struct {
	size int
	color string
}Code language: Go (go)
```

Then I would fulfill the standard library’s [sort.Interface](https://golang.org/pkg/sort/#Interface):

```
type Interface interface {
    Len() int
    Less(i, j int) bool
    Swap(i, j int)
}Code language: Go (go)
```

I would then be able to use the [sort.Sort](https://golang.org/pkg/sort/#Sort) function:

```
sort.Sort(fruitSlice(cars))Code language: Go (go)
```

## 11. Does Go support generic programming?

Go doesn’t currently support generics, but [support is coming soon](https://blog.golang.org/generics-proposal). Generics will allow us as developers to write code that operates on types without needing to re-implement the same function multiple times for all the different types.

For example, say you want to implement a Binary Tree in Go, that can store any type of item. This *should* be easy, because the binary tree shouldn’t care about the types it stores, it never needs direct access to them. Currently, you only have two options: rewrite the tree for every type you want to support, or use an interface and cast the type every time you insert or remove something from the tree, neither of which are ideal solutions.

## 12. Is `ni`l only valid on pointer types?

Nope! `nil` is the zero value for pointers, interfaces, maps, slices, channels, and function types. `nil` represents an *uninitialized* value.

## 13. Does Go provide support for OOP via classes?

No, Go isn’t an object-oriented programming language. Interfaces are the way we handle most abstractions in Go, and it requires an entirely different way of thinking.

## 14. How do you export functions from a package?

Exported function in Go just need to be capitalized.

```go
func DoWork(){
    // this function is usable outside this package
}

func doWork(){
    // this function is NOT usable outside this package
}
```
