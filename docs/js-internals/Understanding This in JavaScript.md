## Conceptual Overview of "this"

When a function is created, a keyword called `this` is created (behind the scenes), which links to the object in which the function operates.

**The this keyword’s value has nothing to do with the function itself, how the function is called determines this's value**

## Default "this" context

```javascript
// define a function
var myFunction = function () {
  console.log(this);
};

// call it
myFunction();
```



What can we expect the `this` value to be? By default, `this` should always be the window Object, which refers to the root—the global scope, except if the script is running in strict mode (`"use strict"`) `this` will be undefined.

## Object literals

```javascript
var myObject = {
  myMethod: function () {
    console.log(this);
  }
};
```



What would be the `this` context here?...

- this === myObject?
- this === window?
- this === anything else?

Well, the answer is **We do not know**.

Remember
**The this keyword’s value has nothing to do with the function itself, how the function is called determines the this value**

Okay, let's change the code a bit...

```javascript
var myMethod = function () {
  console.log(this);
};

var myObject = {
  myMethod: myMethod
};
```



Is it clearer now?
Of course, everything depends on how we call the function.

`myObject` in the code is given a property called `myMethod`, which points to the `myMethod` function. When the `myMethod` function is called from the global scope, this refers to the window object. When it is called as a method of `myObject`, this refers to `myObject`.

```javascript
myObject.myMethod() // this === myObject
myMethod() // this === window
```



This is called **implicit binding**

### Explicit binding

Explicit binding is when we explicitly bind a context to the function. This is done with `call()` or `apply()`

```javascript
var myMethod = function () {
  console.log(this);
};

var myObject = {
  myMethod: myMethod
};

myMethod() // this === window
myMethod.call(myObject, args1, args2, ...) // this === myObject
myMethod.apply(myObject, [array of args]) // this === myObject
```



Which is more precedent, implicit binding or explicit binding?

```javascript
var myMethod = function () { 
  console.log(this.a);
};

var obj1 = {
  a: 2,
  myMethod: myMethod
};

var obj2 = {
  a: 3,
  myMethod: myMethod
};

obj1.myMethod(); // 2
obj2.myMethod(); // 3

obj1.myMethod.call( obj2 ); // ?????
obj2.myMethod.call( obj1 ); // ?????
```



Explicit binding takes precedence over implicit binding, which means you should ask first if explicit binding applies before checking for implicit binding.

```javascript
obj1.myMethod.call( obj2 ); // 3
obj2.myMethod.call( obj1 ); // 2
```



### Hard binding

This is done with `bind()` (ES5). `bind()` returns a new function that is hard-coded to call the original function with the `this` context set as you specified.

```javascript
myMethod = myMethod.bind(myObject);

myMethod(); // this === myObject
```



Hard binding takes precedence over explicit binding.

```javascript
var myMethod = function () { 
  console.log(this.a);
};

var obj1 = {
  a: 2
};

var obj2 = {
  a: 3
};

myMethod = myMethod.bind(obj1); // 2
myMethod.call( obj2 ); // 2
```



### New binding

```javascript
function foo(a) {
  this.a = a;
}

var bar = new foo( 2 );
console.log( bar.a ); // 2
```



So `this` when the function has been called with new refers to the new instance created.

When a function is called with new, it does not care about implicit, explicit, or hard binding, it just creates the new context—which is the new instance.

```javascript
function foo(something) {
  this.a = something;
}

var obj1 = {};

var bar = foo.bind( obj1 );
bar( 2 );
console.log( obj1.a ); // 2

var baz = new bar( 3 );
console.log( obj1.a ); // 2
console.log( baz.a ); // 3
```



### API calls

Sometimes, we use a library or a helper object which does something (Ajax, event handling, etc.) and it calls a passed callback. Well, we have to be careful in these cases. Example:

```javascript
myObject = {
  myMethod: function () {
    helperObject.doSomethingCool('superCool',
      this.onSomethingCoolDone);
    },

    onSomethingCoolDone: function () {
      /// Only god knows what is "this" here
    }
};
```



Take a look at the code. You might think that because we are passing `this.onSomethingCoolDone` as a callback, the scope is `myObject` a reference to that method and not to the way to call it.

To fix this, there are a few ways:

- Usually libraries offer another parameter, so then you can pass the scope you want to get back.

```javascript
myObject = {
  myMethod: function () {
    helperObject.doSomethingCool('superCool', this.onSomethingCoolDone, this);
  },

  onSomethingCoolDone: function () {
    /// Now everybody know that "this" === myObject
  }
};
```



- You can hard bind the method to the scope you want (ES5).

```javascript
myObject = {
  myMethod: function () {
    helperObject.doSomethingCool('superCool', this.onSomethingCoolDone.bind(this));
  },

  onSomethingCoolDone: function () {
    /// Now everybody know that "this" === myObject
  }
};
```



- You can create a closure and cache `this` into `me`. For example:

```javascript
myObject = {
  myMethod: function () {
    var me = this;

    helperObject.doSomethingCool('superCool', function () {
      /// Only god knows what is "this" here, but we have access to "me"
    });
  }
};
```



I do not recommend this approach because it can cause memory leaks and it tends to make you forget about the real scope and rely on variables. You can get to the point where your scope is a real mess.

This problem applies also to event listeners, timeouts, forEach, etc.
